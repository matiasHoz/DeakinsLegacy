          <h1>Biography</h1>
          <p>
            Roger Alexander Deakins, CBE, ASC, BSC is a British cinematographer
            best known for his work in films like ‘The Shawshank Redemption’,
            ‘No Country for Old Men’, ‘Skyfall’, ‘Sicario’ and more recently,
            ‘Hail, Caesar!’ He is the preferred cinematographer for the Coen
            Brothers and other eminent directors like Sam Mendes and Denis
            Villeneuve. Interested in painting and photography since his early
            life, he studied graphic designing. He then started his career in
            filming documentaries and gradually made his way into Hollywood. His
            signature cinematographic style adheres to using simple lighting
            design, often with only a couple of light sources and shooting films
            using only spherical lenses. Apart from cinematography, he has also
            been the visual consultant for a number of hit animation movies like
            ‘WALL-E’, ‘How to Train Your Dragon’ etc. He is a member of both the
            American and British Society of Cinematographers and has been
            honoured with the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 2013
            for his contribution to cinema. In 2011, he received the prestigious
            American Society of Cinematographers Lifetime Achievement Award. He
            has also received twelve nominations for the Academy Award for Best
            Cinematography. He continues to inspire film enthusiasts with his
            talent and work.
          </p>

          <p>
            Deakins was born in Torquay in the English county of Devon. His
            father ran a construction company, while his mother was an actress
            and amateur painter. Deakins attended Torquay Boys' Grammar School.
            He took up painting from a young age, and subsequently enrolled in
            the Bath Academy of Art in Bath, Somerset, where he studied graphic
            design. While studying in Bath, Deakins developed a passion for
            photography; he cited the photographer Roger Mayne, who was then a
            guest lecturer at the academy, as a major source of inspiration.
            After college, Deakins applied to the newly opened National Film
            School, but was denied admission as his photography was considered
            not "filmic" enough. He spent the following year wandering the
            countryside, photographing rural life in North Devon, before finally
            being admitted to the National Film School in 1972. Director Michael
            Radford was one of Deakins's schoolmates
          </p>

          <p>
            After graduating, Deakins found work as a cameraman, assisting in
            the production of projects for about seven years. An early project
            of his involved filming a nine-month trip on a yacht as an entrant
            of the Whitbread Round the World Race, titled Around the World with
            Ridgeway. Deakins was hired to film two documentaries in Africa. His
            first, Zimbabwe, was a clandestine documentation of the Rhodesian
            Bush War, while his second, Eritrea – Behind Enemy Lines, depicted
            the Eritrean War of Independence. He also shot anthropological
            documentaries in India and Sudan. During the late 1970s and early
            1980s, Deakins was involved in a number of music-related projects,
            including Blue Suede Shoes, a music documentary about the British
            rockabilly scene, the concert film Van Morrison in Ireland, and the
            Ray Davies musical film Return to Waterloo. He also made short music
            videos for Herbie Hancock, Eric Clapton, Marvin Gaye, Tracey Ullman,
            Madness, Level 42 and Meat Loaf
          </p>

          <p>
            Deakins's first dramatic project was miniseries titled Wolcott,
            about a black detective working in the East End of London. The
            camerawork of the miniseries impressed his former schoolmate and
            frequent collaborator Michael Radford, who enlisted Deakins for
            their first dramatic feature, the 1983 film Another Time, Another
            Place. The film screened at the Cannes Film Festival and was
            well-received; subsequently, Deakins and Radford teamed up again on
            Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984), based upon George Orwell's novel of the
            same name. The film was praised for its bold, unusual palette, which
            Deakins achieved through a process known as bleach bypass, where the
            silver is retained in the print, creating a washed-out look that
            reflected Orwell's bleak vision. Deakins was the first Western
            cinematographer to use the technique, which has since become highly
            influential and could be seen in films such as Seven (1995) and
            Saving Private Ryan (1998). Throughout the 1980s, Deakins continued
            working in Britain, serving as cinematographer for films including
            Defence of the Realm (1986), Sid and Nancy (1986), White Mischief
            (1987; his third feature film with Radford), Stormy Monday (1988)
            and Pascali's Island (1988).
          </p>

          <p>
            In 1991, Deakins began his long-term collaboration with the Coen
            brothers, starting with the film Barton Fink. The Coens had been
            impressed with Deakins's work, and reached out to him after their
            previous collaborator Barry Sonnenfeld left to pursue a career in
            directing. The film won the Coens' the Festival de Cannes 1991 Palme
            d'Or and Best Director awards (and John Turturro the award for Best
            Actor), and earned Deakins best cinematography awards from New York,
            Chicago and Los Angeles film critics circles. In 1994, the year
            Deakins was admitted to the American Society of Cinematographers, he
            served as cinematographer for The Shawshank Redemption, which earned
            him his first Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography, and
            his first American Society of Cinematographers Award. He received
            two further Academy Award nominations in that decade, for Fargo
            (1996) and Kundun (1997).
          </p>

          <p>
            For the Coen brothers film O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000),
            Deakins spent some two months fine-tuning the look, turning the lush
            green Mississippi landscape into a burnt, autumnal yellow and
            desaturating the overall image. This feat made O Brother the first
            ever feature film to be digitally color-corrected in its entirety,
            and earned Deakins his fourth Academy Award nomination. The
            following year, for his work in the Coen brothers' The Man Who
            Wasn't There (2001), Deakins received his fifth Oscar nomination and
            won his first BAFTA Award for Best Cinematography.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2008, Deakins received dual Oscar nominations—his sixth and
            seventh—for The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert
            Ford (2007) and No Country for Old Men (2007). He was the first
            cinematographer to achieve such a feat since Robert Surtees, who was
            nominated for The Last Picture Show and Summer of '42 in 1972.
            Deakins served as director of photography for Stephen Daldry's The
            Reader (2008) but left mid-production due to delays and previous
            commitments, and was replaced by Chris Menges. The two
            cinematographers received a shared nomination for Best
            Cinematography at the 81st Academy Awards. Deakins worked with the
            Coens on the 2010 western True Grit—their eleventh collaboration—for
            which he received his ninth Oscar nomination.
          </p>

          <p>
            Deakins signed on as cinematographer for Skyfall (2012), having
            previously worked with director Sam Mendes on Jarhead (2005) and
            Revolutionary Road (2008). For his work, Deakins received another
            Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography, eventually losing
            to Claudio Miranda of Life of Pi—his 10th nomination without
            securing a win. In addition to his live-action work, Deakins served
            as both cinematography and visual consultant on his animated work,
            Rango (2011), and also served as a visual consultant on animated
            features, including WALL-E (2008), Puss in Boots (2011), Rise of the
            Guardians (2012), The Croods (2013), the How to Train Your Dragon
            trilogy (2010, 2014 and 2019) and Vivo (2021).
          </p>

          <p>
            Starting with Prisoners (2013), Deakins began working with director
            Denis Villeneuve. The two proceeded to collaborate on Sicario (2015)
            and Blade Runner 2049 (2017), with Deakins earning Oscar nominations
            for all three films. For his work on Blade Runner 2049, Deakins
            received his first Academy Award for Best Cinematography on his 14th
            nomination. Deakins reunited with Sam Mendes on the 2019 war film
            1917, filmed and edited to appear as one uninterrupted take, for
            which he received his second Academy Award on his 15th nomination.
