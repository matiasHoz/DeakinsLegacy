<div class="parte1">
<p class="texto">Roger Alexander Deakins, is a British cinematographer. 
  Interested in painting and photography since his early life, he studied graphic designing. 
  He then started his career in filming documentaries and gradually made his way into Hollywood. 
  His signature cinematographic style adheres to using simple lighting design, often with only a 
  couple of light sources and shooting films using only spherical lenses.
  He is a member of both the American and British Society of Cinematographers.</p>

<p class="texto">Deakins attended Torquay Boys' Grammar School. He took up painting from a young age, 
  and subsequently enrolled in the Bath Academy of Art in Bath, Somerset, where he studied graphic design. 
  While studying in Bath, Deakins developed a passion for photography. After college, Deakins applied to 
  the newly opened National Film School, but was denied admission as his photography was considered not 
  "filmic" enough. He spent the following year wandering the countryside, photographing rural life in 
  North Devon, before finally being admitted to the National Film School in 1972.</p>

<p class="texto">After graduating, Deakins found work as a cameraman, assisting in the production of projects 
  for about seven years. Roger was hired to film two documentaries in Africa. He also shot anthropological 
  documentaries in India and Sudan.  During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Deakins was involved in a number 
  of music-related projects, including Blue Suede Shoes, a music documentary about the British rockabilly 
  scene. He also made short music videos for Herbie Hancock, Eric Clapton, Marvin Gaye, Tracey Ullman, 
  Madness, Level 42 and Meat Loaf.</p>

<div class="parte2">
<p class="texto2">Deakins's first dramatic project was miniseries titled Wolcott, about a black detective 
  working in the East End of London. The camerawork of the miniseries impressed his former schoolmate and 
  frequent collaborator Michael Radford, who enlisted Deakins for their first dramatic feature, the 1983 
  film "Another Time, Another Place". Throughout the 1980s, Deakins continued working in Britain, serving as 
  cinematographer for films including "Defence of the Realm" (1986), "Sid and Nancy" (1986), "White Mischief" 
  (1987).</p>

<p class="texto2">In 1991, Deakins began his long-term collaboration with the Coen brothers, starting with 
  the film Barton Fink. The Coens had been impressed with Deakins's work, and reached out to him after 
  their previous collaborator Barry Sonnenfeld left to pursue a career in directing. In 1994, the year Deakins was 
  admitted to the American Society of Cinematographers, he served as cinematographer for The Shawshank 
  Redemption, which earned him his first Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography.</p>

<p class="texto2">In 2008, Deakins received dual Oscar nominations for The Assassination of 
  Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007) and No Country for Old Men (2007). He was the first 
  cinematographer to achieve such a feat since Robert Surtees. For his work on Blade Runner 2049 (2017), 
  Deakins received his first Academy Award for Best Cinematography on his 14th nomination. Deakins reunited with 
  Sam Mendes on the 2019 war film 1917, filmed and edited to appear as one uninterrupted take, for which 
  he received his second Academy Award on his 15th nomination. </p>
